# bardr: Shakespeare's Complete Works for R

Have you ever felt that the R programming language suffered from a critical
lack of the Bard? Well, worry no more.

The bardr package provides the complete text of William Shakespeare's
complete works as native R files which have already been substantially
pre-processed to make them easy to use.

The complete works are contained in both a list and a tidy data frame format,
and each individual work has also been separated and stored as a character
vector.
